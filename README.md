# Musical Instruments - project for XML processing class.

This is a final project I created for my XML processing class. XML file contains information about ten musical instruments. HTML page allows user to display all of them, filter them by category or by search phrase.

## Goal
The final project consisted of the following tasks:

1. Create XML document at any topic (containing at least 10 elements)
2. Add XSLT and CSS stylesheets in order to create nice-looking page using XML data.
3. Add DTD file 
4. Create a HTML page with buttons to display filtered items using JavaScript and implement full-text search (and use XPath expressions).
